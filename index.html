<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I will obtain my third master’s degree in <b>Political Science</b> at International University of Japan soon, following the first Master of <b>Finance</b> at Zhejiang Univeristy of Finance and Economics in China, and the second Master of <b>Computer Science</b> at College of William and Mary in the U.S. <br /> Last October I completed a research intern at <b>Asian Development Bank Institute</b> in Japan. I used to serve as a regional director at Huaxia Bank in charge of <b>Anti Money Laundering & Countering Terrorism Financing</b> and work for China Academy of Financial Research (an affiliation institution of ZUFE) as a reasearch & program specialist. <br />
Currently I focus on <b>economic policy uncertainty</b>, FDI divestment and its implications on US-China decoupling. Thanks to my technical and analytical capabilities, I am also interested in effects of <b>digital financial literacy</b> on Fintech use and financial behaviors across gender categories, income scales and education levels. <br />
My dream positions include <b>Data Analyst</b> and <b>Researcher</b> in a think tank, NGO or international organization. Also, I am fascinated with Chinese traditional culture and history. </p>
